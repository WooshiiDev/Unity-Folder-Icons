## About

A small extension for unity adding custom folder textures and overlay icons. This came about after discussing the limitations of what Unity already provides in terms of customisation in it's Editor. 

Some of the code does need refined/seperated (more so for future additions), and there are many, many features I'd like to personally add and see improved when I work on this.

## Installation

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/WooshiiDev/Unity-Folder-Icons/releases">Releases</a> • <a href="https://github.com/WooshiiDev/Unity-Folder-Icons/releases/download/0.1.2/Folder.Icons.v0.1.2.unitypackage">Unity Package</a> • <a href="https://github.com/WooshiiDev/Unity-Folder-Icons/archive/0.1.2.zip">Zip</a>
</p>



FolderIcons can also be installed directly through the git url
```
https://github.com/WooshiiDev/Unity-Folder-Icons.git
```

**Note:**<br>
If installed through git, to access the premade folder textures, there will be an import sample button in the package manager.
<br>After imported, the textures will have their alpha transparency off and will need to be turned on manually. <br>A fix for this will be applied soon.

## Features

Currently, Folder Icons primary features are:

### Folder Custom Textures/Icons

Project Folders can have custom icons and textures applied through the Folder Icons ScriptableObject.
You can add and remove folders from the list displayed at the top of the settings.

### Flat Texture Creator

Generally, you don't want folders to be noisey or overly messy. Directories need to be clean and appealing to look at. 
<br><br>
The texture creator, will take in a texture, and apply a custom colour to all visible pixels in respect to the alpha. These textures can then be saved and used for folders or icons.
